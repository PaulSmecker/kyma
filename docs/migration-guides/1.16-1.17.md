# Migration from v1.16 to v1.17

## Eventing

In Release 1.17, we remove the support for Knative-Serving from Kyma. After the upgrade Knative-Serving is still 
installed and fully functional in the cluster, but can be removed easily in order to free resources. Removing 
Knative-Serving will not affect supported Kyma functionality.

Before you remove Knative-Serving from the cluster, make sure that you create a backup of any of your own resources that used 
Knative-Serving. You can do this by running:

```bash
kubectl get serving -A -oyaml > <backup-file-name>
```

To remove the `knative-serving` chart, execute:

```bash
helm delete knative-serving -n knative-serving
``` 
>**NOTE:** This requires Helm version 3.x

This command renders Knative-Serving inactive, but all user-created configuration is still available in the cluster. 
To also remove user-created configuration, run:

```bash
kubectl delete crd \
  certificates.networking.internal.knative.dev \
  configurations.serving.knative.dev \
  images.caching.internal.knative.dev \
  ingresses.networking.internal.knative.dev \
  metrics.autoscaling.internal.knative.dev \
  podautoscalers.autoscaling.internal.knative.dev \
  revisions.serving.knative.dev \
  routes.serving.knative.dev \
  serverlessservices.networking.internal.knative.dev \
  services.serving.knative.dev
```
